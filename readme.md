# Responsive patterns

This project is a collection of responsive patterns built with HTML and CSS.

The boilerplate for a new pattern is created by copying and renaming the directory called 'template' in the root of the project. For a pattern with multiple implementations the index.html file is copied and renamed.

Some implementations can be a little rough around the edges; the intention is to cover the most important 90%.
