# Responsive patterns

[https://rnsloan.github.io/responsive-patterns/](https://rnsloan.github.io/responsive-patterns/)

Playground of HTML and CSS patterns. Some of these are pretty old and date back to when IE8- support was common.

The boilerplate for a new pattern is created by copying and renaming the directory called 'template' in the root of the project. For a pattern with multiple implementations the index.html file is copied and renamed.

Some implementations can be a little rough around the edges; the intention is to cover the most important 90%.
